# Hornets-Nest Overview
This repo will function as a repo for a number of resources/brain dumps that I collate relating to a lot of security. I try to learn both red and blue team elements as I believe red team informs blue team. You cannot detect what you don't know exists or is possible. This is a kind of 'purple teaming' philosophy. 

This is my effort at giving back to the security community- ill try to keep it tidy! ;)

# Honey-all-the-things ideas

Before looking into these interesting fun things to do - you absolutely must have good AD configuration in place. A couple of helpful examples:

https://adsecurity.org/?page_id=4031

https://adsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-DerbyCon-ActiveDirectorySecurity-BeyondTheEasyButton-Metcalf.pdf 

Unfortunately this isn't always possible due to internal politics in a company, rejected changes, or 100 other reasons - which is where the below becomes more of use. 

One of the best videos i've ever watched on cyber-deception in AD : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLWGJ3f3-gI

The logging GPO settings required are within Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Audit Policies

(Account Logon)

 Audit Credential Validation  - Success and Failure   
 Audit Kerberos Authentication Service  - Success and Failure   
 Audit Kerberos Service Ticket Operations - Success and Failure   
 Audit Other Account Logon Events - Success and Failure 
  
 (DS Access)

 Audit Directory Service Access - Success and Failure  
 
 (Logon/Logoff)

 Audit Logon - Success and Failure   

 (Object Access)

 Audit Detailed File Share - Success and Failure   
 Audit File Share - Success and Failure   
 Audit File - Success and Failure   


## Powersploit landmine:
Powersploit has a script called "Get-GPPPassword" - this file does the following:

Get-GPPPassword searches a domain controller for groups.xml, scheduledtasks.xml, services.xml and datasources.xml and returns plaintext passwords.

This can be used for our advantage by setting up a dummy GPO, or even just a basic xml file named something the above, with a value in it that contains a password of our own design. You would then set up auditing on this folder within SYSVOL on your domain, and alert if this particular file is accessed. 

A baseline example xml file could be the following (from https://www.andreafortuna.org/2019/02/13/abusing-group-policy-preference-files-for-password-discovery/ )
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Groups clsid="{3125E937-EB16-4b4c-9934-544FC6D24D26}"><User clsid="{DF5F1855-51E5-4d24-8B1A-D9BDE98BA1D1}" name="Administrator (built-in)" image="2" changed="2017-10-10 11:23:48" uid="{355F2024-75C3-4EB4-9A16-BE114035625F}"><Properties action="U" newName="" fullName="" description="" cpassword="VPe/o9YRyz2cksnYRbNeQj35w9KxQ5ttbvtRaAVqxaE" changeLogon="0" noChange="1" neverExpires="1" acctDisabled="1" subAuthority="RID_ADMIN" userName="Administrator (built-in)"/></User>
</Groups>
```
You could use the cyberchef recipe at the top of this page to create a new string and enter that into the cpassword variable.

Some example files : https://github.com/s0lari/Decoy-sploit

## Honey files
General other honey files can be created in a similar fashion and scattered around file shares deep in the structure that contain strings such as 'password' 'pass' 'secret' 'administrator' etc so that any other automated powershell scripts will find them and trigger audit rules in your SIEM (ELK/Splunk etc).

## Honey users
Create a user that is not used by the business in any way and set the logon hours to full deny. Set up detection for any logon attempts to this user - this will detect password sprays.

Also see the bloodhoud section in the Splunk Detections area below to use this in a similar fashion.

###### Kerberoasting Honey SPN

Set up a service account that is not used by the business in any way and set the logon hours to fully deny. Set up detection for any logon attempts to an SPN that is configured on this account. Whitelist any maintenance/configuration systems. This should be a high fidelity detection on kerberoasting.

Set ServicePrinciple name like so :
```
setspn -U -A http/blah SERVICE_USER_ACCOUNT_HERE (had mixed results with this)
SetSPN -a <computer name>/random-name-spn <domain>\<newly created service account name> (worked most recently in lab)
```
See Splunk Detections section for example query.

###### AS-REP Roasting honey user

To increase the attack surface of kerberoasting detections, we can also create a new user account that has the option "Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication" within the user properties within Active Directory Users and Computers > Account tab > Account Options (scroll to the bottom). 

Check for logging on Event ID 4768 containing the user account name that you configured. Depending on the tool, there may also be a event ID 4625 to go along with the 4768 event at near the same time.

Detection logic :

```
index=winevent_sec EventCode=4768 Account_Name=xxxxxx
```

Where xxxxxx is the name of the AS-Rep Roast honey user.

**COUNTER-POINT: Some red-teamers will check for honey accounts - generally this is done by checking when the account was last used/logged into - if you have a script/manual process that logs into that account once every 14 days or so, you should be alright -whitelist this activity in SIEM**

## Inverted logic honey detection

On the topic of red team / threat actor hunting for honey accounts - if we assume that they do indeed find some of these accounts, they may sculpt their attacks around these beacons, much like someone may try to navigate a minefield. We can also use this to our advantage if we invert the logic of the detection.

An example may be that we have a number of honey users or honey SPN accounts created. If assume that the attacker knows that these accounts are beacons, then we can also imagine that they will continue with the attacks that they have in mind, but make exceptions for these accounts in their tools and not password spray/kerberoast those accounts, but will continue to action all the other accounts. We can build a detection for this by checking for large numbers of requests, but of those results, they do not contain the honey entries. 

A logic would be something like (haven't managed to test, but take the principle and re-work the query language):

```
index=winevent_sec EventCode=4769 Ticket_Options=0x40810000 Service_Name!="*$" Service_Name!="krbtgt" Account_Name!="*$@*" Service_Name!="super_not_shady_SPN"
| dedup Service_Name 
| stats count by user 
| where count>X (where x is a good baseline) 
```

Where Service_Name=super_not_shady_SPN is a honey SPN. This could also just as easily be user=xxxxxxx or any other honeyAD Object. 

This will bring up all the SPNs that have been queried except the honey account, dedupe the service names, count them by user - if the baseline triggers high (obviously having whitelisted known services and management tools that regularly query AD etc and trigger this rule), and it is missing the honey accounts, we may have an attempted bypass of the honey SPN beacon. 

So if the attacker attempts to kerberoast/password spray, and does so generally, we will detect them - if they attempt to bypass the beacons, we will detect them. Either way, we should detect them.

The only way the attacker would be able to get around this is by slowing down his attacks to almost a one-by-one approach, and attempting to stay under the threshold of the time range of the detection - but that is exactly what we're trying to at least do - dictate the rules in an attack engagement. Depending on the time range of the detection, you could severely slow down any kind of attack like this.

We are still using the honey accounts, but it is their odd absence that we're tracking - so instead of it being anomalous that they are being accessed, in the context of large sweeps, it is anomalous that they're NOT being accessed. Build out inverse logic detections like this where possible (it may not be) for when you implement a honey object.

# Splunk Detections

```

## BLOODHOUND:

Previous detection methods for bloodhound revolved around looking at large numbers of LDAP connections via network logs, however, that may have changed slightly given the recent developments from @cptjesus:

> Ben Campbell @Meatballs__ pointed out that SharpHound spins up a large number of LDAP connections when doing enumeration, which causes a significant amount of overhead on building Kerberos handshakes. He provided an alternative solution which maintains a persistent LDAP connection. As of 2.0, SharpHound will use a cached LDAP connection to request resources which should speed up enumeration time in group enumeration at the very least, and possibly in more areas.

If you were unable to log at this level (flat network) or someone was running the latest version of bloodhound, you may not be able to detect this in the standard way. Therefore the following is an interesting alternative.

Some inspiration from http://www.stuffithoughtiknew.com/2019/02/detecting-bloodhound.html and help from @CTOBInsights with the Splunk query. You will also have to enable this in GPO : Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Audit Policies > DS Access : Audit Directory Service Access (success and failure)


When you run Bloodhound, you get the following events on your AD Security log after having configured logging on a particular canary user (see the link above):

Using these properties lookups can function like a fingerprint for BloodHound activity - there are a lot of Active Directory queries and operations that query AD attributes and properties that are not in these forms, so you can use this to remove false positives.

This should give a pretty good result for user based Bloodhound detection, but in order to detect computer based checks, a similar setup will need to be created, except with a canary computer account. This can be done simply by creating a new computer object in the 'computers' OU in Active Directory Users and Computers, then applying the same auditing rules that are configured as the canary/honey user. This will create the same Event Code 4662 logs:

# Defense in Depth Security stack

Fundamentally you're going to be in a pretty good place if you manage these things in your environment - aims mainly at Windows Domain environements (brain dump, no priority/order as each environment is different, some are absolute must tho):

0) BACKUPS - Ransomware is real - test your backups, do DR scenarios - tape is old, but at least it is disconnected from environemnt.
1) Remove local admin account usage for standard users
2) Enable host based firewalls on your internal client machines (treat internal network as hostile) & Segment internal networks (eg by department - makes logging easier as well as users generally do the same kinds of activities, so long tailed stat analysis is easier)!
3) Disable LLMNR & NBNS & SMB v1 on your network (do even more with CIS hardening guides), and disable WPAD if it isn't explicitly used.
4) Use AV - ensure it is running - if you can afford NGAV+EDR - awesomesauce!
5) Use application whitelisting - SRP is good when you have no alternative
6) Log all your things - sysmon, Active Directory, web apps - Azure Sentinel, Various ELK Stacks.  Pretty cheap is Rapid 7 InsightIDR, which hooks into 11.
7) Email filtering solution (O365 is not bad) 
8) If you're using anything O365/Azure - get the Advanced Threat Protections/ UEBA solutions - they're pretty good
9) Deploy Sysmon and have that logged to your SIEM - various configs available - see below.
10) Deploy Honey tokens/files/users/admins/SRP/GPO/pots/networks
11) Vuln scanner - Rapid7 InsightVM is good. It also dumps vulnerability data into InsightIDR
12) Patch your stuff! As fast and as much as businessly possible.
13) Get a UTM firewall (Fortigate are pretty good and not as expensive as Palo Alto) - this will allow the following:
14) Internet Web Whitelisting (ie, default deny unless category/site specifically allowed)
15) DNS Filtering
16) Web App firewalling on your webapps & Network IPS all the things!
17) Gateway AV
18) App control at gateway (good for detecting/preventing DNS tunneling & CASBI functionality too)
19) 802.1x/Forticlient has a similar function that denies access
20) Encrypt your laptops with Bitlocker + PIN
21) Lock down windows store
22) Lock down cmd/powershell usage
23) 2FA - DUO is very good. Used in conjuntion with an SSL VPN can work nicely - means your internal webapps are not directly accessible too!
24) Threat intelligence feed for your logs in your SIEM
25) TRAIN YOUR STAFF! All is for naught if your staff aren't well trained, both users and SOC. Pluralsight has some good content - SANS/OSCP = excellent standard. This will enable more advanced functions once you reach maturity, like threat hunting and purple teaming.
26) DLP - don't spend a huge amount of time on this, much bigger wins possible - prevents accidental loss of data.
27) Incident response plans - make some, test them. Tabletop exercises can be useful.
28) Audit domain passwords - use pass-phrases, enforce 15 character minimum after LOTS of training and LOTS of patience. Think https://xkcd.com/936/ - totally do-able and in the past in the entire company only had 1 person need to reset the next day. Dump the ntds.dit file via shadow copy and crack using a decent GPU rig and hashcat. Have those users change their passwords - test and retest. If you can't crack it using some big lists, it will reduce risk quite a bit.
29) haveibeenpwned.com - self explainatory
30) Disallow the use of personal email (gmail/hotmail etc) - no point in spending loads of money on filtering and tech only to have your workstations pwned by a personal phishing email.
31) OSINT/Recon check yourself - see what is available or posted by your users! Especially Linkedin for technologies used by admins/secops.

# Lab Setup

Choose your relevant cloud provider (azure do 30 day trials, but the systems are a bit sluggish - Google cloud boxes are fast though!)

One of my major gripes with demos and labs that folks show is that they show the attack and relevant detections in isolation from what would be a production environment, with all the relevant noise and events that are a part of a normal day to day network. 

I came across an awesome couple of scripts that can solve this issue at least to some extent:

https://github.com/ubeeri/Invoke-UserSimulator

https://github.com/lorentzenman/sheepl

I've had some success with the first module (haven't had a chance to try the 2nd) and given that it is powershell based, it works natively to windows. 

General setup could be :

1) 1 Domain controller server and relevant Active Directory configuration
2) 1/2 Servers domain joined
3) 1/2 Client machines with office installed (see below) that are also domain joined.
4) 1 Offensive system that is not domain joined, but on the same network (this can simulate an external attacker to host tools/c2 etc- you could totally go the exta mile and configure another network entirely with relevant VM firewall appliances etc, but it is a time/cost vs what are you trying to demonstrate decision).

## Office 

OK - Office deployment automation:

Step 1, are you gonna be doing it repeatedly or potentially in a bandwidth-limited environment?  If so, run the download step once to some storage which is 1) referenceable as a windows drive letter from wherever you want to finally install it and 2) permanent so it's not gonna get wiped out by automated teardown of a server etc.

1 - Set up your staging

Use the Office Deployment Tool (ODT, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=49117)

Installing that small tool will set up a folder hierarchy that acts as your staging for the rest of the actions; this staging setup can be on a different system than where you want the final install.

2 - How to define which bits of Office you want (inc language packs, 32v64 bit versions, and optionally, how to license it automatically / pre-accept the EULA for promptless install)

All of this is driven by an XML file; making it yourself is a pain, but there is a generator wizard at https://config.office.com/ that I'd recommend using

That config file acts for both the download and install steps.

3 - Download

In the staging from step 1, you will have a setup.exe.

Run it as admin from a command or powershell prompt:

setup.exe /download configuration.xml (this being the file you created in stage 2)

You'll get no visual prompts at this stage but you'll see the system bandwidth use increase and some new files appear in the staging environment, just let it run (about 3.5 GB last time I did this) until the cmd drops you back to a prompt.

4 - Install

Move setup.exe and configuration.xml to the system on which you are installing

Remember to modify configuration.xml filepaths (quotes required around full path even when no spaces) if you're installing it from a remote system

Run as admin:

setup.exe /configure configuration.xml

You should immediately get the Office install splash page and it should auto config

5 - Initial config (only bit I'm not familiar with automating, sorry...usually intended to be end-user facing)

Run any office app from the standard suite (word, excel etc - NOT Outlook for first run)

Follow the sign-in / 365 account connection wizard.
